# Codecourt

Codecourt is a playground for your coding experiments. It's like a basketball court, but for coding projects. I use it to showcase, test, and experiment with various coding techniques and ideas.

## Features

- A platform to host and experiment with coding projects.
- Currently under development, but a great place to showcase smaller ideas and tests.
- Built with React and Vite.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zofienora/codecourt.git
